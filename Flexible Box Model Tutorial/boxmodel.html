<!--Learning about the future of web development using the box model-->

<!--Explainations about the procedure of the box method-->

<!--Day 1: Flexible Box Model (Beginning)-->
<!--Day 1: First we wrapped the main section and the side news in a new div tag-->
<!--Day 1: Then in the css file we reset the margin and the padding to 0px-->
<!--Day 1: Then we fixed the headers by changing font and size-->
<!--Day 1: Then we fixed the display block issue by mentioning all the tags we used so they would show as one under each other-->
<!--Day 1: Now we put the body width as 100%-->
<!--Day 1: Then we need to alter the display-->
<!--Day 1: This means that we need to put flexible boxes inside this website-->
<!--Day 1: To do this we need to type display:-webkit-box- -->
<!--Day 1: We are using these special kits to help with flexible boxes-->
<!--Day 1: Then you type -webkit-box-pack: center;-->
<!--Day 1: What this says is that the boxes will be centered on the website-->
<!--Day 1: Flexible Box Mode (Ending)-->

<!--Day 2: Styling the Header and Navigation (Beginning)-->
<!--Day 2: First we started to decorate the Header-->
<!--Day 2: So we first set the max-width since it depends on the device that you are using like from your phone to your laptop-->
<!--Day 2: The width changes due to the screen resolution but we need to set a maximum width for any device-->
<!--Day 2: Typed max-width: 1000px-->
<!--Day 2: Then we set the margin and enter display;-webkit-box;-->
<!--Day 2: Then we can use the webkit in order to layout the block elements-->
<!--Day 2: So you type -webkit-box-orient: vertical; and this prevents the website from displaying it from left to right-->
<!--Day 2: Then we also need to make our website flexible and this means that the website will adjust to the resolution of the deivce-->
<!--Day 2: So we type -webkit-box-flex: 1;-->
<!--Day 2: The reason why we put the number 1 is because it allows our website to be flexible from shrinking to growing-->
<!--Day 2: If we give it the value of 0 then it will not be flexible and all the elements are fixed can't be moved--> 
<!--Day 2: Then we decorated the top header like we did with the previous website-->
<!--Day 2: We decorated the background, border, padding-->
<!--Day 2: Then we decorated the top_menu--> 
<!--Day 2: We decorated the border, background, color-->
<!--Day 2: Then we decorated the links in the top_menu by typing #top_menu li -->
<!--Day 2: Then we typed, display:inline-block; and inline means to position the links from left to right-->
<!--Day 2: Then we removed the bullets by typing list-style:none; -->
<!--Day 2: Then we put the font and padding-->
<!--Styling the Header and Navigation (Ending)-->
