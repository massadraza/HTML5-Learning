<!--Day 1: Reversing the Box Order (beginning)-->
<!--Day 1: First we started with a new template and created a section with an id of parent-->
<!--Day 1: In this section we put 4 kids and decorated them in the css file-->
<!--Day 1: We learned a new trick since kid 1, kid 2, kid 3, kid 4, is the order set by default-->
<!--Day 1: Theres a trick that you can do in the css file which can reverse the order-->
<!--Day 1: It will change it from kid 1, kid 2, kid 3, kid 4 to kid 4, kid 3, kid 2, kid 1-->
<!--Day 1: You need to type in the parent class -webkit-box-direction:reverse; and it will reverse the standard layout-->
<!--Day 1: Reversing the Box Order (Ending)-->

<!--Day 2: More Flexible Box Model Tricks (beginning)-->
<!--Day 2: All codes for the tricks are located in the css file-->
<!--Day 2: More Flexible Box Model Tricks (Ending)-->

<!--Day 3: Finishing up the Flexible Box Model (beginning)-->
<!--Day 3: First we learned how to make all the boxes flexible-->
<!--Day 3: To do this get rid of the set width that you put for each kid-->
<!--Day 3: And for each kid put "-webkit-box-flex:1;" and what happens is all the boxes will be an equal size-->
<!--Day 3: And all 4 boxes will reach to the maximum width of the parent-->
<!--Day 3: Then we learned about having a box flex value of more than one-->
<!--Day 3: When you type the box flex value - "-webkit-box-flex:#; you can put a number more than one-->
<!--Day 3: Like for example if you input the value of 2 it will take up the space of 2 normal boxes-->
<!--Day 3: Basically, it's saying that it grew 2 times in width-->
<!--Day 3: Now for the next example give each box an equal height and give the parent class a larger height than the kids-->
<!--Day 3: Now when you look at the website you see the boxes and see the empty space on the bottom-->
<!--Day 3: But it looks odd that all the kids are tucked up in the top, what if you want them to be centered-->
<!--Day 3: To center them, in the parent class on css type "-webkit-box-align:center;"-->
<!--Day 3: What this does is it will center all the kids in the parent class-->
<!--Day 3: If you want the boxes to stretch to fit the entire box, instead of puting center, you can put stretch-->
<!--Day 3: Other commands you can put are start for left, end for right, baseline, for the top-->
<!--Day 3: Finishing up the Flexible Box Model (ending)-->
