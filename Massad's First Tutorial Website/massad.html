<!--Day 2: Then we write all the tags in the css file to make sure that the browser can recognize these elements and they will be displayed as block elements-->
<!--Day 2: Then you need to center the entire website-->

<!--Day 3: Styling the Navigation Menu-->
<!--Day 3: We added style to the div body tag. To mention a div tag use the # sign-->
<!--Day 3: We decorated the border, the width, margin and text align-->
<!--Day 3: Then next we work on the top header where the titile is.-->
<!--Day 3: To decorate this we need to mention the top_header tag with the # sign-->
<!--Day 3: Then in the top_header we decorated the background, border, and padding-->
<!--Day 3: Now we will work on the top_menu where our links are like home, about me, contact us-->
<!--Day 3: We decorated the background, color of the font-->
<!--Day 3: Then we reference the top menu again execpt adding li to the end of it-->
<!--Day 3: Then we decorated so the text will display from left to right-->
<!--Day 3: Then we decorated the list-style, padding, font and bold-->

<!--Day 4: Making Everything Pretty--> 
<!--Day 4: First we started decorting the main_section where the two articles were located-->
<!--Day 4: First we moved the articles to the left by floating it to the left-->
<!--Day 4: Then we set the width of this section to 660px-->
<!--Day 4: We also included a margin of 30px-->
<!--Day 4: Now the news section is now on the right side and the article is one the left side-->
<!--Day 4: Now we will decorate the side_news bar-->
<!--Day 4: We floated it to the left and made the width 220px-->
<!--Day 4: The margin is 20px on the top and 0px on the bottom-->
<!--Day 4: Padding is 30px-->
<!--Day 4: Then we put the background color of light blue-->
<!--Day 4: Now the news section has that light blue color-->
<!--Day 4: So now we will work on the footer-->
<!--Day 4: We want the footer to be on the bottom center with a margin seperating them apart-->
<!--Day 4: So we need to take away the floating properties by clear:both;-->
<!--Day 4: Then we centered the copyright claim-->
<!--Day 4: Then we added 20px of padding-->
<!--Day 4: Since we only want only a border on the top by doing border-top: 2px solid green;-->
