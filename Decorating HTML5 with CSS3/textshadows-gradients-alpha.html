<!--Day 2: Text Shadows, Gradients, and Alpha (beginning)-->
<!--Day 2: First in this example we will learn how to apply a text shadow-->
<!--Day 2: Then in the css file under the #text put "text-shadow:rgb(110,110,110) 3px 3px 5px;-->
<!--Day 2: To know what each number means please refer to day 1-->
<!--Day 2: You don't need to use webkit since it's already built in-->
<!--Day 2: Now we will be using gradients-->
<!--Day 2: We will be putting a gradient on the background-->
<!--Day 2: To put a gradient type "background:-webkit-linear-gradient(###, ####, ####)"-->
<!--Day 2: The first input is where do you want the first color to start-->
<!--Day 2: Some inputs are top, bottom, left, right-->
<!--Day 2: The second input is the first color and the third input is the second color-->
<!--Day 2: If you want the gradient to start at an angle put in the first input-->
<!--Day 2: ##deg, in the ## you can put any number and put at the end of it deg to indiciate an angle measure-->
<!--Day 2: Now if you want a radical gradient which means that the color starts in a circle then fades outwards-->
<!--Day 2: To do this type "-webkit-radial-gradient(center,circle,red 0%, orange 50%)" -->
<!--Day 2: You must put center and circle then you can put anything for the first and second color-->
<!--Day 2: The higher percentage for the first color the more there will be solid color-->
<!--Day 2: And for the second number the percentage means of where will the fading start-->
<!--Day 2: Lastly we will be using Alpha-->
<!--Day 2: What Alpha does is that it makes the shadow more transparent-->
<!--Day 2: Instead of using the shadow "-webkit-box-shadow:rgb(110,110,110) 10px 10px 3px-->
<!--Day 2: Use "-webkit-box-shadow:rgba(110,110,110, #) 10px 10px 3px"-->
<!--Day 2: So instead of using rgb you use rgba and in the fourth input you need to put a value-->
<!--Day 2: The lower the value the lighter the shadow is-->
