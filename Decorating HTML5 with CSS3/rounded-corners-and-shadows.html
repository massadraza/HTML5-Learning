<!--Day 1: Rounded Corners and Shadows (beginning)-->
<!--Day 1: First we made a basic website with only one box-->
<!--Day 1: To make the corners of a box you need to type in the css file-->
<!--Day 1: -webkit-border-radius:##px-->
<!--Day 1: In the px you can write any number, the higher the number it is, the more round the corners will be-->
<!--Day 1: Then to make a shadow appearance for an element on a website type-->
<!--Day 1: To create a shadow type -webkit-box-shadow:rgb(##,##,##) ##px ##px ###px-->
<!--Day 1: The first three numbers in the brackets are the level of darkness, the more higher the numbers are the lighter they are the lower they are the more darker it is-->
<!--Day 1: The next numbers are the left and right controls-->
<!--Day 1: The first number shifts the shadow to the right-->
<!--Day 1: The second number shifts the shadow down-->
<!--Day 1: Then the third number does the blur of the shadow, the higher it is the more blur it is-->
<!--Day 1: If you want the shadow to be inside of the element instead of the outside of the element-->
<!--Day 1: After the three pixel values you can put a key word inset and it will revert the shadow inward-->
<!--Day 1: Rounded Corners and Shadows (Ending)-->
