<!--Day 5: Making Awesome Rollover buttons (beginning)-->
<!--Day 5: In this example we will learn how to make cool animations with buttons-->
<!--Day 5: First we need to use webkit and type "-webkit-transition:-webkit-transform 2s"-->
<!--Day 5: What this is showing is we are indicating that we are using a transition and we are going to transform this box-->
<!--Day 5: And the 2s means that the entire transformation will take 2 seconds-->
<!--Day 5: Then after that on the same line you can mention each element that you want to have an effect on-->
<!--Day 5: Like here we typed "opacity 2s, background 2s, width 2s, height 2s"-->
<!--Day 5: Now we have all the things that we want to animate now we can proceed with the psuedo class hover-->
<!--Day 5: In the hover class you need to type "-webkit-transform: rotate(360deg)"-->
<!--Day 5: Everything typed in here is based upon every element we mentioned previously-->
<!--Day 5: Like the opacity background etc-->
<!--Day 5: So I typed "opacity 1;", "background:#1ec7e6", "width:450px", "height:110px"-->
<!--Day 5: Now everything is animated so now you can check to see if the animation works and it does-->
