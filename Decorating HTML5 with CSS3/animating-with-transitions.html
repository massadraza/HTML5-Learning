<!--Day 4: Animating with Transitions (beginning)-->
<!--Day 4: In this example we will learn how to make animations that occur when your mouse goes over it-->
<!--Day 4: To do this you need to use the psuedo class hover-->
<!--Day 4: Type #box:hover{}-->
<!--Day 4: Then in this class type "-webkit-transform:rotate(45deg)" -->
<!--Day 4: Now when you hover over it it rotates 45 degrees-->
<!--Day 4: But what happens if you want the transition to be smooth-->
<!--Day 4: Like you can actually see the box rotating in slow mo-->
<!--Day 4: To do this in the normal css class type "-webkit-transition: -webkit-transform #s-->
<!--Day 4: After the semi colon you can put the property that is in the pseudo class then after that you need to put a number-->
<!--Day 4: Which will tell how many seconds does this animation need to last-->
<!--Day 4: Once you done that now when you hover over it it slowly animates showing full animation-->
