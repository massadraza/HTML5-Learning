<!--Day 3: Crazy Transformations (beginning)-->
<!--Day 3: First we are learning how to make an additional border-->
<!--Day 3: To do this type outline:7px soild red;-->
<!--Day 3: What this does is it adds an additional border to the box-->
<!--Day 3: The pixel size and the color is changable-->
<!--Day 3: Now we will learn how to do transform boxes-->
<!--Day 3: First we will learn how to scale boxes-->
<!--Day 3: To do this type -webkit-transform:scale(1.5)-->
<!--Day 3: This made the box bigger-->
<!--Day 3: You can also scale using the x and y axis by typing-->
<!--Day 3: -webkit-transform:scale(#,#)-->
<!--Day 3: Then instead of doing scale there is also rotate-->
<!--Day 3: Rotate will rotate the box-->
<!--Day 3: To do this type -webkit-transform:rotate(45deg)-->
<!--Day 3: Then it will rotate based upon the value-->
<!--Day 3: Then after toate there is skew-->
<!--Day 3: Skew is when it changes the boxes angle and it can change the shape of the box-->
<!--Day 3: To use skew type -webkit-transform:skew(30deg)-->
<!--Day 3: Then there is also translate and it moves boxes and objects-->
<!--Day 3: To do this type -webkit-transform:translate(150px,300px)-->
<!--Day 3: It will move the box according to the pixels you said -->
<!--Day 3: Up and left are negative and right and down are positive-->
<!--Day 3: If you want to use all of these effects all at once type all of it on the same line-->
